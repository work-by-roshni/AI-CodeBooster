The user accesses the system via a web browser and provides their OpenAI API key through the Streamlit interface.
The user uploads a Python code file using the file upload widget in the Streamlit interface.
The system extracts the text content from the uploaded code file and sends it as an input prompt to the GPT-3 model for code review.
The GPT-3 model processes the input prompt and generates a code review.
The generated code review is displayed in the Streamlit interface for the user to view and potentially take action based on the feedback.
